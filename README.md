# Customer Behavior Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer behavior based on transactional data. The analysis includes understanding transaction quantities, values, popular brands, top-performing stores, and correlation between numerical variables.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [Hackathon_Ideal_Data.csv](/content/drive/MyDrive/customer analysis/Hackathon_Ideal_Data.csv). It contains transactional data including customer ID, transaction quantity, transaction value, store code, brand, and company details.

## Analysis
The analysis is performed using Python in Google Colab. The key steps of the analysis include:

1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Cleaning: Any missing values are handled.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various statistical analyses and visualizations are performed to understand customer behavior.
4. Insights Extraction: Key insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior are derived.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes the following visualizations:

1. Histograms of transaction quantities and values.
2. Count plots of transactions per store and top brands.
3. Count plots of transactions per company and top companies.
4. Heatmap of the correlation matrix of numerical variables.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
